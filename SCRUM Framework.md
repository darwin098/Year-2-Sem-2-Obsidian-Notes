## Definition
---
- An [[Agile Development Methodology]] framework to utilize:
	- [[Object-Oriented Analysis]] & [[Object-Oriented Design]]
	- In order to create more complex products
- An iterative and incremental approach


## Process
---
- Based on a stable and dedicated cross-functional team
- Team is supposed to be self organizing
- Sprints are planned at the start, one at a time
- Product is decided by the product owner
- The team decides how much to commit to per sprint
- The team tries to meet its commitment, but can under or over deliver depending on the sprint's outcome
- The length of the sprint does not change during the sprint

### Transparency
- All aspects of the process must be visible to those managing the outcome

### Inspection
- All aspects of the process must be inspected with skill and diligence in order to prevent unacceptable variances (i.e. Quality Control)


## SCRUM Sprints
---
- A regular, repeatable 
- The duration can be one to three weeks (Decided by the team)
- A shippable product must be created at the end of each sprint
- Each sprint will produce a well-tested, defect-free product
- At the end, we inspect and adapt the product and process

### 1) Timeboxes
(Refer to schematic)
- Timeboxes are created to enforce regularity

#### 2) Release Planning Meeting
To:
- Establish plans and goals so that the team and related personnel can understand and communicate
- Establish priority in Product Backlog (Refer to Product Backlog section)
- Identify risks
- Identify overall features and functionality of the product
- Establish the delivery date and cost

#### 3) Sprint
- Scrum master to make sure that the goal of the sprint will not be changed

##### Sprint Planning Meeting
To:
- Plan the duration for the sprint
- Allow the product owner to present the top priority product backlog
- Decide what will be done in the sprint
- Review the product backlog, latest increment of the product, capacity and past performance of the team
- Figure out how to build the product
- Identify and create tasks (Sprint Backlog)
- Let the product owner clarify the product backlog
- Invite technical or domain specialists 

##### Daily Scrum
- To inspect the progress toward what the team has committed to the sprint goal and to the product backlog items
	- Team meets for 15 minutes daily to inspect and adapt to any changes (Conducted at the same time and place throughout the spring)
	- Each member explains
		- What he has accomplished since the last meeting
		- What he is going to do before the next meeting
		- The obstacles he face
- Scrum master ensures that the team has the meeting daily

##### Sprint Review
- Conducted at the end of each spring
- Scrum team and stakeholders collaborate on what has been produced
- based on the product and changes to the product backlog, they collaborate about the next steps
- Product owner identifies what has been and has not been done, along with the project completion dates
- Team discusses problems encountered

##### Sprint Retrospective
- Scrum master encourages the team to revise the development process to improve efficiency
- Inspect how the last sprint went in regard to people, relationships, process and tools
- Team identifies actionable improvement measures to implement in the next sprint
