## Purpose
---
- To develop a system right
- To develop the right system (A system where user requirements are met)
- For use case modelling - Effectively capturing / documenting the user requirements

## Artefacts
---
### Use Case Diagram
- Consists of use cases, actors and relationships between actors and use cases, and also between use cases
- Shows the overall functionalities of the system
- Helps in defining the scope of the system to be built

#### Actor
##### 1) Users of the system
	- Users represents the role of the user play with respect to the system
##### 2) Other systems that will interact with the system built
##### 3) Devices
##### 4) Time

#### Use Case
- Represents the use of functionality of the system from the users' perspective, that are of value to the actors
- Specifications:
	- Format of a use Case
	- Flow of Events
		- Expected Flow
		- Alternate Flow
		- Error Flow
	- Pre-condition
	- Post-condition

##### Example

#### Relationship
- A use case must be called by another use case whenever it is activated

##### Types
- Extend Relationship
	- A use case is optionally called by another use case when activated
	- Direction of arrow is towards the calling use case

## Steps
---
1) Find actors
2) Find use cases of actors
3) Find relationship
