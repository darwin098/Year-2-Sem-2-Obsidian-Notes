|-|-|
| Centralized control & management | Lack of centralized control |
| More efficient file management | Inconsistent availability |
| Better security | Poor security |
| Excellent logging facilities | Uneven performance |
| More difficult to configure & manage | Simple to setup  |
| Requires additional hardware & software | Minimal additional hardware/software required |
| If server goes down, resources are unavailable | Printers & files can be easily shared |
