- The message or data to be transmitted (In plaintext)
- The plaintext is modified by the encryption process to produce ciphertext which is then transmitted
- The encryption depends on a predefined key
- Each encryption method uses a specific algorithm, known as a cipher, to encrypt and decrypt messages
- A cipher is a series of well-defined steps used to encrypt and decrypt data
- There are several methods of creating ciphertext
	- Transposition
