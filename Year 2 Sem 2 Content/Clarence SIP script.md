## How old are you?

## Are you working as of now?

## What are hobbies do you have?

## Would you consider the people here in Singapore friendly?

## Would you consider yourself conscious of saving water?
Yes. Since my family lived in a semi-rural area of Beijing, water has sort of been a scarcity due to it being polluted around us. Thus, my family raised me and my brother up with the values of the importance of water, leading to us being conscious about how we use and save our water in Singapore as well.

## What age have you come to Singapore and how long have you been here?
My family migrated from Beijing into Singapore when I was 6 or 7, and from there I started my Singapore education from primary school until now. So I've been here for about 12 years now.

## Would you mind sharing your experiences with unsafe water back in Beijing?
Back in the village, our only water source was an old well, if i remember correctly. I checked with my family yesterday through pictures we had, in preparation for today, haha. 

The well was dug deeper every 5 years, it seems as the water would not come out as much. We had rivers around as well, but my brother and I was always told not to drink from it as it would make us sick.

Thinking back, it was probably because of water pollution. Our parents used to scare us with stories of how others in our village used to fall sick after drinking the water during periods of droughts. Thankfully our village was pretty close to a city so no one really died from it, haha.

## What made you and your family come to Singapore?
We as a family went to visit Singapore once and my parents like it here quite a lot, so when my father had the opportunity to get a promotion and work in a branch here in Singapore, we took it and came here. More reasons were for example, an increased quality of life, the transport system, convenience and safety. We also wouldn't have to worry about the water issues back in the village if we came to Singapore.


## How do you feel about drinking safe water in Singapore?
I don't really remember anything of me drinking unclean or unsafe water back in the village, Jus that we had to boil the water from the well every time we wanted to drink it and that it was a hassle as we have to boil and then store the water elsewhere every day.

Here, we have a filtration system, but I also sometimes drink the water from the tap, haha. So I feel like its more convenient.

## Could you compare the clean water access between Singapore and Beijing?
As I've said, in the village we only had the well. In Singapore there are taps everywhere and toilets also have a flushing system everywhere. So I think the water access is very advanced compared to a village. The water also can drink from all of the taps as its all clean. That's very good, but after living here for 12 years I kind of got used to it ah haha. 

But if we compare the standards and accessibility of course Singapore will be much better. In the village we only had water from the well and toilets weren't flushable as we didn't really have water pipes installed.

## What issues did you face back in Beijing?
Well, for my village not too much. We were close to the city and my father had a stable job, so we didn't really have any fear of not having food or money and if water was needed, my father could also buy some from the city, though it didn't really make sense financially so we didn't do that since there wasn't a need to.

However, from what I heard, my relatives in more rural areas have it hard as their wells are kind of drying up and the water sources are unable to be utilized. They are mostly relying on the water from the government and the well. The drought back in, if I remember correctly, back in 2012 hit them especially hard and they had to go through water rationing or something like that. 

Most of the people there have already moved out so I think the situation there is slightly better? Can't really say, haha. 

## Could you tell me your opinion on why you think these issues exist in the first place?
I think water pollution is because of the people ah. The factories, coal mining, even the farms send water back to the rivers and lakes etc. Then the government is only sending water, relieving the effects of a cause they are not fixing. It might be changing now, but I'm not too sure.

## What do you think would help to alleviate the issues?
I think the government being like Singapore, adopting the technology. In Singapore the sewage and wastewater is recycled into clean drinking water right, the new water or something. If every country in the world start doing this then slowly even the polluted sources can become clean lah. 

I think the government also need to impose more rules on the people causing the pollutants ah. Like if they have people checking and stuff then the factories won't be able to release the polluted water. How they deal with the wastewater is as I said, the New Water technology. China population I think also increasing quickly right, so there needs to be much more effort and urgency to fix the country's water sources. Maybe come up with some new technology to filter a lake quickly or something, haha.

## Would you want to go back and live in the same village in the future?
Honestly, no, I wouldn't want to. The quality of life here in Singapore is just so much better, not to mention all my friends are here as well. Having access to clean drinking water here, not to mention the convenience of living here as well, just make it so much more worthwhile to live here. Even if the water situation improves over there, I don't think that it will be as convenient to live in there compared to here. The only downside of Singapore is the high cost of living. More things are that Singapore has no natural disasters, while droughts and other natural disasters also happen back there in Beijing.

## According to "ChinaWaterRisk", the government plans to ease water shortages in Northern China, by building lines that will transport water from South China to the North. What are your thoughts?
I think that transporting water to the North is only one of the steps that can be taken to combat this water scarcity issue. Sure, it might alleviate the access physically, but the price of water will definitely rise and the general population of the north will probably have to pay water bills, meaning that they will probably be buying water from the government. If wells and natural water sources are used, these villages will be able to have the water they need without paying for it. 

Hence, I think that what is really needed, will be the de-pollution of the water sources in China instead.
