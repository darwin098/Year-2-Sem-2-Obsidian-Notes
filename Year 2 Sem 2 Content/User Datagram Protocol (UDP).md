- For connectionless communications
- No connection establishment
	- The sending host sends out data without establishing the connection first
	- Assume that there is a path to reach the receiving host
- No flow-control
- Unreliable transmission
	- The sending host does not expect and does not wait for acknowledgement from the receiving host
	- No detection of failed transmission, and hence no re-transmission is possible
