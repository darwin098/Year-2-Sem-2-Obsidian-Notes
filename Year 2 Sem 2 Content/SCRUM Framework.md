## Definition
---
- An [[Agile Development Methodology]] framework to utilize:
	- [[Object-Oriented Analysis]] & [[Object-Oriented Design]]
	- In order to create more complex products
- An iterative and incremental approach


## Process
---
- Based on a stable and dedicated cross-functional team
- Team is supposed to be self organizing
- Sprints are planned at the start, one at a time
- Product is decided by the product owner
- The team decides how much to commit to per sprint
- The team tries to meet its commitment, but can under or over deliver depending on the sprint's outcome
- The length of the sprint does not change during the sprint

### Transparency
- All aspects of the process must be visible to those managing the outcome

### Inspection
- All aspects of the process must be inspected with skill and diligence in order to prevent unacceptable variances (i.e. Quality Control)


## SCRUM Artefacts
---
- [[Product Backlog]]
- [[Release Burndown]]
- [[Sprint Backlog]]
- [[Sprint Burndown]]

## Before SCRUM Sprints
---
- SCRUM is taught to everyone
- SCRUM roles are assigned
- Vision and goals are presented to the Team and stakeholders
- Creation of [[Product Backlog]]
- Product Owner and Team create a [[Definition of Done (DoD)]]

## SCRUM Sprints
---
- The duration can be one to three weeks (Decided by the team)
- A shippable product must be created at the end of each sprint
- Each sprint will produce a well-tested, defect-free product
- At the end, we inspect and adapt the product and process

### 1) Timeboxes
(Refer to schematic)
- Timeboxes are created to enforce regularity

#### 2) Release Planning Meeting
To:
- Establish plans and goals so that the team and related personnel can understand and communicate
- Establish priority in [[Product Backlog]]
- [[Points Assignment]]
- Identify risks
- Identify overall features and functionality of the product
- Establish the delivery date and cost
- Setup development and test environments
- Do initial high-level design / architecture (Just enough to get started)

#### 3) Sprint
- Scrum master to make sure that the goal of the sprint will not be changed

##### Sprint Planning Meeting
For the Team, Product Owner and Scrum Master to:
- Plan the duration for the sprint
- Allow the product owner to present the top priority [[Product Backlog]]
- Decide what will be done in the sprint
- Review the [[Product Backlog]], latest increment of the product, capacity and past performance of the team
- Figure out how to build the product
- Identify and create tasks ([[Sprint Backlog]])
- Let the product owner clarify the [[Product Backlog]]
- Invite technical or domain specialists 

- Determine the type of sprint:
	- Velocity-based
		- When a team has a stable history of how many Product Backlog items they can complete in a sprint, they commit based on the recent historical average
	- Capacity-based
		- The team estimates its capacity for work during the spring (Eg In hours or days), then commits to only as many [[Product Backlog]] items as they have capacity for

##### Daily Scrum
Goal:
- To inspect the progress toward what the team has committed to the sprint goal and to the [[Product Backlog]] items
- Enable the team to update each other daily

- Team meets for 15 minutes (maximum) daily to inspect and adapt to any changes (Conducted at the same time and place throughout the spring)
- Each member explains
	- What he has accomplished since the last meeting
	- What he is going to do before the next meeting
	- The obstacles he face
- Scrum master ensures that the team has the meeting daily

During the meeting:
- Everyone listens, no discussions
After the meeting:
- Team discusses as needed
- SCRUM Master helps with [[Blocks]]

##### Sprint Review
- Usually 1-2 hours for a 2-week sprint
Goal:
- Inspect and Adapt the Product
	- Try out what the team has produced
	- Inspect quality and doneness
	- Inspect whether it is right for customer needs
	- Identify improvements (added to [[Product Backlog]])

- Testers invited to give hands on feedback
- Scrum team and stakeholders collaborate on what has been produced
- Based on the product and changes to the [[Product Backlog]], they collaborate about the next steps
- Product owner identifies what has been and has not been done, along with the project completion dates
- Team discusses problems encountered

##### Sprint Retrospective
- Usually 1-2 hours for a 2-week sprint
Goal:
- Inspect and Adapt the process
	- Talk about the good & bad experiences of the sprint
	- Agree on a plan for improving our way of working in the next sprint

- Scrum master encourages the team to revise the development process to improve efficiency
- Inspect how the last sprint went in regard to people, relationships, process and tools
- Team identifies actionable improvement measures to implement in the next sprint

- Each (Team, Scrum Master and Product Owner) should take feedback from each other

## SCRUM teams
---
- Scrum teams are Cross-Functional, i.e. they are not limited to one skill

### Roles
- Scrum Master
	- Responsible for ensuring the process is understood and followed (3 Ps)
	- 3 Ps:
		- Process Owner
			- Teaches SCRUM to the team, product owner, and stakeholders
			- Coaches team, product owner and stakeholders to achieve maximum value and Return of Investment (ROI) by improving practices
		- Problem Solver
			- Helps remove blocks and assists team and product owner
		- Protector
			- Protects the team from disruption
- Product Owner
	- Responsible for maximising the value of the work that the team does
	- Leads the development by conveying the vision of the product to the team
	- Manages the [[Product Backlog]]
- Team
	- Responsible for doing the work
	- Consists of developers with all kinds of skill sets
	- Makes the product owner's vision and requirements into a useable product and the end of each sprint
