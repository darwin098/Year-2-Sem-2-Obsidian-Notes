- A structuring technique that groups network protocols according to their functions
	- Each group is a layer of a layered network model
	- Each layer is independent from every other in its purpose and responsibilities
	- Each layer is independent from every other in its purpose and responsibilities
	- Each layer of the network uses the protocols and software of the layer below it
	- Each layer communicated with the layer above it so that the higher layer can use the resources it provides
- Reasons for layering
	- Simplifies the network model
	- Enables programmers to specialize in a particular level or layer of the networking model
	- Provides design modularity
	- Encourages interoperability
	- Allows for standardized interfaces to be produced by networking vendors
