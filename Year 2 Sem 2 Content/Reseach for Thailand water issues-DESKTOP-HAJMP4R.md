## Background information
The Kingdom of Thailand is located in the South-eastern region of Asia with a population of over 70 million people (Worldometer, 2022) and covers a land area of 513,115 square kilometres. There are four main geographical regions in the country: the North, the Central Plains, the Northeast, and the south. (Suwal, 2022)

There are a total of 25 river basins in the country and Thailand's annual rainfall is around 1700mm. Due to the increasing population, urbanization, agricultural and industrial expansion, the water quality of various water sources are being affected. Pollutants from human activities also contribute to the degradation of the water quality. The severe flooding in the rainy season and extreme drought in the dry season could become two major sources of Thailand's water crisis. (Suwal, 2022)

The primary sources for drinking water for many Thai citizens are from surface and ground water sources. Untreated domestic sewage, industrial wastewater and solid hazardous wastes have increased in the surface water bodies. It is reported that one third of the surface water is of poor quality in Thailand (Suwal, 2022)

The largest source of groundwater is in the Lower Central Plains surrounding Bangkok and is used to meet the region's water demands. This source is begin polluted by Agricultural run-off pollutants, aqua culture and sewage. (Suwal, 2022)

Flood, drought, water pollution and increasing demand for water clearly shows the need for an integrated development of water resources and management in Thailand. Many institutional, regulatory and budgetary issues still remain (Netherlands Embassy, 2021)

## How many people have access to clean water?
The country reports that the proportion of households able to access clean drinking water has increased from 97% in 2012 to 99.5% in 2019, and government efforts to provide clean water for villages without existing plumbing systems have been successful, with the number of such villages reduced from 7,321to 169. (Thailand, 2021)

## Problems in Thailand
However even with government efforts, Data from the Ministry of Public Health’s Report on Drinking Water Quality from 2009-2019 showed that only 40.8% of water available to households was appropriate for consumption. 43.7% of water in households needed further treatment before consumption, while a further 15.5% comprised water that had been contaminated by chemicals above the recommended limit. Further studies have also shown that 59.2% of water used in households was not of the required standard. (Thailand, 2021)

## Solutions needed
There seems to be a need to create solutions to make sure that the water supply can keep up with the country's growing water demand. Solutions that will be able to provide the country with a stable supply of water even in time of drought would be needed.
