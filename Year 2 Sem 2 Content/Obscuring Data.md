## Data Masking
---
- A technology that secures data by replacing sensitive information with a non-sensitive version
- The non-sensitive version looks and acts like the original
- This means that a business process can use non-sensitive data and there is no need to change the supporting applications or data storage facilities

- Commonly limits the propagation of sensitive data within IT systems by distributing surrogate data sets for testing and analysis

- Data masking techniques that can ensure that data remains meaningful but changed enough to protect it
	- Substitution
		- Replaces data with authentic looking values to apply anonymity to the data records
	- Shuffling
		- Derives a substitution set from the same column of data that a user wants to mask
		- Works well for financial information in a test database

## Steganography
---
- Conceals data (the message) in another file such as a graphic, audio, or other text file
- Advantage over [[Cryptography]] is that the secret message does not attract any special attention
- No one would ever know that a picture actually contained a secret message by viewing the file

## Data Obfuscation
---
- The use and practice of data masking and steganography techniques in the cybersecurity and cyber intelligence profession
- The art of making the message confusing, ambiguous, or harder to understand
- A system may purposely scramble messages to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information
- Software watermarking protects software from unauthorised access or modification
- Software watermarking inserts a secret message into the program as proof of ownership
- The secret message is the software watermark. If someone tries to remove the watermark, the result is non-functional code
