## Definition
---
- The tampering with systems and the data contained within
- The exploitation of resources
- Accessing systems and sensitive information without authorization
- The disruption of normal business operations and processes
- Causes [[Cyber Harm]]

## Motivations
---
### 1) Financial Gain
- Usually the case
- To generate cash flow from
	- Bank accounts
	- Personal data
	- Anything that can be leveraged

### 2) Trade Secrets and Global Politics
- Nation states are also interested in using cyberspace: 
	- To hack other countries
	- To interfere with internal politics
	- For industrial espionage
	- Gain advantages in international trade

## Types
---
### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
- A type of network attack
- Results in some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications
- A major risk as they can easily interrupt communication and cause a significant loss of time and money. These attacks are relatively simple to conduct, even by an unskilled attacker

### Sniffing
- Similar to eavesdropping on someone
- Occurs when attackers examine all network traffic as it passes through their NIC, independent of whether or not the traffic is addressed to them or not

### Spoofing
- An impersonation attack, and it takes advantage of a trusted relationship between two systems
- If two systems accept the authentication accomplished by each other, an individual logged onto one system might not go through an authentication process again to access the other system

### Man-in-the-middle (MitM) 
- A criminal performs a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting communications between computers to steal information crossing the network
- The criminal can also choose to manipulate messages and relay false information between hosts since the hosts are unaware that a modification to the messages occurred
- MitM allows the criminal to take control over a device without the user's knowledge

### Zero-Day Attacks
- Sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat
- A computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor
- Zero hour describes the moment when someone discovers the exploit

### Keyboard Logging
- A software program that records or logs the keystrokes of the user of the system 
- Criminals can implement keystroke loggers through software installed on a computer system or through hardware physically attacked to a computer
- The criminal configures the key logger software to email the log file. The keystrokes captured in the log file can reveal usernames, passwords, websites visited, and other sensitive information
