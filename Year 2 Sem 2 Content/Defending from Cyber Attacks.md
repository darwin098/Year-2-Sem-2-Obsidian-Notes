## Fundamental security principles for defences
---
### 1) Layering
- Layered security approach (defence-in-depth)
	- Useful in resisting a variety of attacks
	- Provides the most comprehensive protection

### 2) Limiting
- Limit access to information - reduces the threat against it
- Only those who must use data should be granted access to what they only need to do their job
- Methods:
	- Technology-based, Eg file permissions
	- Procedural, Eg prohibiting document removal from premises

### 3) Diversity
- Makes sure layers are different as repeating a bypassed layer will not be effective
- So that the breaching of one security layer does not compromise the whole system
- Such as:
	- Using security products from different manufacturers
	- Different groups responsible for regulating access

### 4) Obscurity
- Obscuring inside details to outsiders
- Such as not revealing the details of:
	- The type of computers used
	- The operating system used
	- The brand of software used
- Leads to more difficulty for the attacker to devise an attack due to unknown details

### 5) Simplicity
- A secure system should be simple from the outside, but complex from the outside
