- Occurs when organizations do not put in place robust logging mechanisms or respond to alerts of potential attacks
- Allows attackers to achieve their goals without being detected

## Example
---
- A major US retailer was sent warnings by an internal malware analysis but did not take action until it was hit by fraudulent card transactions by an external bank

## Prevention
---
- Ensure all login, access control failures and input validation failures are logged to identify suspicious or malicious accounts, and held for enough time to allow forensic analysis
- Set up monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activities in a timely fashion
