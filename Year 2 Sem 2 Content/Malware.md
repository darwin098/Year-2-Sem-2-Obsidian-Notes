- Software designed to disrupt computer operations, or gain access to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission
- Breaches networks through [[Vulnerabilities]], typically when a user clicks a dangerous link or email attachment that then installs risky software

## Functions
---
- Block access to key components of the network (Ransomware)
- Install additional harmful software
- Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (Spy ware)
- Disrupt certain components and renders the system inoperable

## Types
---
### Viruses
- Malicious executable code attached to another executable file, such as a legitimate program
- Requires end-user initiation, and can activate at a specific time or date

### Worms
- Malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks
- Slows down networks
- Able to run by themselves
- Other than the initial infection, worms no longer require user participation

### Trojan Horse
- Carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online game
- Exploits the privileges of the user
- Binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files, or games

### Logic Bomb
- A program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code
- Can be dates, times, other programs running, or the deletion of a user account
- Remains inactive until that trigger event happens
- Once activated, a logic bomb implements a malicious code that causes harm to a computer

### Ransomware
- Holds a computer system, or the data it contains, captive until the target makes a payment
- Usually works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user

### Backdoors and Rootkits
- To the program or code introduce by a criminal who has compromised a system
- The backdoor bypasses the normal authentication used to access a system
- A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer remotely
