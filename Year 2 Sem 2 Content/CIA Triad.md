- A widely used information security model to guide policies for information security in an organization
- Consists of 3 complementary objectives, to govern and evaluate how an organization handles data when stored, transmitted and processed

### Confidentiality
- i.e. Privacy
- Only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data
- Ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information

#### Achieving it
- Cybersecurity professionals develop and implement security controls, including firewalls, access control lists, and encryption to prevent unauthorized access to information
- Methods used to ensure confidentiality include:
	- Data encryption
	- Authentication
	- Access control
- Controlling access
	- Authentication
		- Verifying the identity of a user to prevent unauthorized access
	- Authorization
		- Determining which resources users can access, along with the operations that users can perform
	- Accounting
		- Keeping track of what users do, what they access, the amount of time they access resources and any changes made

#### Possible Threats
- Attackers may seek to undermine confidentiality controls to achieve the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information

### Integrity
- The accuracy, consistency and trustworthiness of data during its entire life cycle
- AKA quality
- Ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or not

#### Achieving it
- Integrity controls, such as hashing and integrity monitoring solutions, seek to enforce this requirement
- Data should be maintained in a correct state and nobody should be able to improperly modify it, either accidentally or maliciously
- Methods used to ensure data integrity include
	- Hashing
	- Data validation checks
	- Data consistency checks
	- Access controls

#### Possible Threats
- Integrity threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of information without authorization or non-malicious sources, such as a power spike, causing the corruption of information

### Availability
- Authorized users should be able to access data whenever they need to do so
- Ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them

#### Achieving it
- Availability controls, such as fault tolerance, clustering, and backups, seek to ensure that legitimate users can gain access when needed

#### Possible Threats
- Availability threats may come either from attackers seeking the disruption of access or non-malicious sources, such as a fire destroying a datacentre containing valuable information or services
