- The network that connects geographically separated LANs
- Uses specifically designed network devices to make the interconnections between LANs
- Spans across a very large geographic area (Eg A country)
- Connects 2 or more [[Local Area Network (LAN)]]s/MANs together using relatively slow-speed connections 
- May use satellite, routers, modems or WAN switches for communications

- If a company or organization has locations that are separated by large geographical distances, it may be necessary to use a telecommunications service provider (TSP) to interconnect the [[Local Area Network (LAN)]]s at the different locations
