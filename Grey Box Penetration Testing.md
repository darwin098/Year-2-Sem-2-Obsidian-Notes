- Penetration testers are placed in the role of a user of the system, potentially with elevated privileges on a system
- Tester typically knows what the internal components of an application are but not how those components interact, reflecting the actual experiences of potential attackers
- Uses both [[Static Application Security Testing (SAST)]] and [[Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)]] tools and are able to focus their attention on more highly-valuable areas within the network, increasing attack coverage and efficiency
